# NishantJoshi00 — GitHub Profile README

## What This Is

GitHub profile README repo (`NishantJoshi00/NishantJoshi00`). The `README.md` renders on the GitHub profile page at github.com/NishantJoshi00.

## Format

The README uses a Unix man page format inside a markdown code block. This is a deliberate creative choice — do not break character or change the format unless explicitly asked.

## Tone

- **Clinical/dry observer voice** — the DESCRIPTION reads like a system report documenting behavior, not a personal bio
- **Escalating absurdity** — each paragraph gets progressively more unhinged while the voice stays deadpan
- Self-deprecation that implies competence, never the reverse
- No emojis. No badges. No widgets. The man page IS the aesthetic.

## Rules

- Do not add GitHub stats widgets, badges, or dynamic content
- Do not break the man page code block formatting
- Keep the `<sub>segfault (core dumped)</sub>` footer
- Numbers should be concrete and verifiable from GitHub data
- When updating stats, use `gh` CLI to pull fresh data
